grbm and sbpl:  both were good fits, errors and stats.

copl:  not a good fit the BGO and LLE/LAT data.  Stat was bad.  obviously a bad fit.

grbm+lpow:  great fit, best stats so far.  good errors.  PL is very clearly at -1.96933 and errors on it are very small.  It's rare to get such certain results for a PLidx.

sbpl+lpow:  same as grbm+lpow, except PLidx= -1.94153 .  Great small errors.  Better AIC and BIC than grbm+lpow.

copl+lpow:  same as above two.  Not as good BIC as sbpl+lpow.  PL= -1.94316

grbm+blackb:  alpha= -1.29942, beta=-2.26026 tem= 468.707 kT= 47.3770.  On the plot, the peaks appear to be near eachother. This happened with another burst where the peaks almost seemed to overlap or switch places.  This was a few bursts ago.  Best stats by far!

sbpl+blackb:  Same as grbm+blackb but with alpha= -1.34503 beta= -2.26276 ebrak= 195.752 kT= 48.5109.

copl+blackb:  This model doens't fit the BGO and LLE/LAT data.  Not a good fit.

blackb+lpow:  The bbody isn't wide enough to account for the rest of the emission.  But it's not a terrible fit.  Better than copl.


grbm+blackb+lpow:  the more you fit it, the steeper the PL gets, making it insignificant.  I couldn't get stability for errors, so I just ran no errors near the best statistic I could get.  PL=-1.66499  tem=505.049 kT=46.7344

sbpl+blackb+lpow:  same as grbm+blackb+lpow.  PL=-1.64422  ebrk=222.264 kT= 47.3964.


copl+blackb+lpow:  good fit, errors, params and stats.
